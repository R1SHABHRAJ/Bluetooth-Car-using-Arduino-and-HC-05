# Bluetooth Controlled Arduino Car
This is a simple project that demonstrates how to make a Bluetooth controlled vehicle using an Arduino microcontroller board. The car can be controlled using a smartphone using any basic bluetooth app available in Playstore(android) or appstore(iOS). This project contains different adapations of enabling the bluetooth car to move, since different HC-05 behave differently and interact with Arduino. Hope one of the program works for you!!

## Requirements
Arduino Uno board
HC-05 Bluetooth module
L293D motor driver IC or L293N motor driver IC
DC motors
LED 
Jumper wires
Breadboard

## Circuit Diagram
I have provided two schematic diagram one with the blue motor driver is called L293D motor driver IC(more accurately motoe shield) and second is L293N motor driver IC. Choose schematic according to your own motor driver. You may need to change some wires based on the direction of the motor rotation and placement.
